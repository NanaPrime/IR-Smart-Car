# This is a car designed to follow a black line, be it tape or otherwise. It is constructed using 3D printed filament for the body, jumper wires, a PIC16F1829 board that came from the Viva board we assembled and utilized in class, two infrared sensorson the front of the car (these would also activate an LED on the board to display the logic levels, when activated), and L298N Motor driver and a 7.4 2S LiPO rechargeable battery.
